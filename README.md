# PredictionsContest

A web app for running live predictions contests. Frontend is built with React.js and backend is built with Express.js. Powered by TypeScript.

## Features

This web app allows admins to create a contest, which is a collection of episodes. Each episode can contain any number of categories that players will be asked to make predictions for. Players login with their Discord account and can submit predictions for each category, which will be scored and added to the leaderboard. The admin can later submit what the correct result was, which will award points to the players who made the correct predictions. Points are tallied up across episodes and across contests and can be viewed in the leaderboard.

### Example Use Case

You might use this web app to run a prediction contest for a game (such as League of Legends) or a show (such as BattleBots). You might have a contest where players submit their predictions for which champion will be picked, or which bot will win the match. The admin can then submit the correct result for each category, which will award points to the players who made the correct predictions. This can be great for making watch parties more interactive and fun.
